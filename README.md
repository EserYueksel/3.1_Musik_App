# 3.1_Musik_App
a daily syntax institute task, creating a music app
This is an Android Studio project for a music app, written in the programming language Kotlin. 
It appears to have a MainActivity as the launcher activity, a ShareActivity, and a DetailActivity. 
The app uses a RecyclerView to display a list of songs, with each item in the list having a title, cover image, and length. 
The project also uses a CardView to make the entire item in the list clickable.
